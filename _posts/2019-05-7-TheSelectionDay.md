Hi, I am Anand Panchbhai. This is the first chapter of my journey as an open source developer for DBpedia as part of the Google Summer of Code 2019. The following posts will provide weekly updates regarding the progress of this project and my first hand experience working on an opensource project that holds the potential to change the way we access data today.

I always wanted be a part of GSoC, and it feels really good to be a part of this community now. I would like to thank all the mentors especially [Tommaso Soru](http://tommaso-soru.it/), [Nausheen Fatma](https://nausheenfatma.wordpress.com/) and Rricha Jalota for providing valuable feedback on my proposal. Here is the link to my [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4615170624585728).
